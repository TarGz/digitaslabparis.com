<p>The first step of the explorations was to made relevant tools do capture datas. (ie : sound recorder and temperature recorder)</p>

<p><img src="http://targz.github.io/digitaslabparis.com/img/resonate14/inspi00-tools.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The second step was to make field recording all around singapore and to manage the datas recorded.</p>

<p><img src="http://targz.github.io/digitaslabparis.com/img/resonate14/inspi00-recording.jpg" alt="image" /></p>
